# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a **Heart Disease Prediction** model using machine learning (Logistic Regression).  
It takes patient health parameters as input and predicts whether the person is likely to have heart disease or not.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Uses a structured heart disease dataset (`heart_disease_data.csv`).
- Performs **data analysis and preprocessing**.
- Splits data into **training and test sets**.
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** model.
- Evaluates model performance using **accuracy score**.
- Builds a simple **predictive system** at the end of the notebook where you can manually input patient data and get a prediction:
  - `1` → Defective Heart (Heart Disease Present)  
  - `0` → Healthy Heart (No Heart Disease)

All the steps are implemented in the Jupyter Notebook:  
`Heart Disease Prediction .ipynb`
